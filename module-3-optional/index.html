                        A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. 
                        The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are 
                        secondary sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male. A few other birds have a comb or similar appendage, 
                        in some cases bearing a different name such as helmet in the guinea, and a few have wattles with some having a single median 
                        one rather than a pair. The comb is the basis of the Latin name or classification of chickens. In Latin, gallus means comb, 
                        and the domestic chicken is Gallus domesticus. The Red Jungle Fowl, ancestor of most domestic chickens, is Gallus bankiva. 
                        There are eight recognized kinds of combs: single, rose, pea, cushion, buttercup, strawberry, V-shaped, and silkie.
                        The chicken has two legs and two wings, a fact that influences housing and management. Domestic chickens have essentially 
                        lost the ability to fly. Heavy breeds used for meat production cannot do more than flap their wings and jump to a little 
                        higher level or move more rapidly along the ground. The lighter-bodied birds can fly short distances, and some can fly over 
                        relatively high fences. The feet and shank portions of the legs have scales.
                        Respiration rate is higher in chickens than in larger animals. In general, it can be said that the smaller the kind of bird 
                        the faster it breathes. For example, a hummingbird breathes more times a minute than a chicken. The male chicken breathes 
                        about 18 to 21 times a minute and the female about 31 to 37 times when they are not under stress.
                        The heart beat of chickens is rather fast, being about 286 times a minute in males and 312 in females in a resting condition.
                        Digestion rate is somewhat rapid in chickens. It varies from 2 1/2 to 25 hours for passage of food depending on whether the 
                        digestion tract is full, partially full, or empty when feed is ingested.
                        The chicken's temperature is about 107 degrees to 107.5 degrees F.
                        Chickens are hatched, not born in the truest sense of the word.
                        Chickens are covered with feathers but have a few vestigial hairs scattered over the body. The average consumer does not 
                        see these hairs, because they are singed off in the processing plant. The chicken has a beak (or bill) and does not have 
                        teeth. Any mastication occurs in the gizzard. Many commercial poultry producers do not provide grit to their chickens, 
                        because they feed a ground feed of fine meal consistency that can be digested by the bird's digestive juices.

                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric
                        times.Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients. Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely 
                        cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye 
                        steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are 
                        usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is 
                        used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, 
                        liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), 
                        the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred 
                        to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie 
                        oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as 
                        natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal. Beef from 
                        steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older 
                        bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised 
                        for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding 
                        operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, 
                        roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% 
                        of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, 
                        Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest 
                        beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan 
                        ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In 
                        comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, 
                        such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

                        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), 
                        usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and 
                        occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", 
                        also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯). Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it 
                        can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, 
                        salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, 
                        and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with 
                        sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional 
                        serving of rice. Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer 
                        plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine. Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by 
                        the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as shō-chiku-bai (松竹梅), shō/matsu (松, pine), chiku/take (竹, 
                        bamboo) and bai/ume (梅, plum), with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest.[citation needed] Sushi restaurants will 
                        often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most 
                        sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept. Sushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) 
                        style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After 
                        finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use 
                        barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared. Unlike sashimi, which is 
                        almost always eaten with chopsticks, nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. 
                        Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a bento, a box 
                        with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.
