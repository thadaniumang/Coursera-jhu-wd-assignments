                        A chicken is a bird. One of the features that differentiate it from most other birds is that it has a comb and two wattles. 
                        The comb is the red appendage on the top of the head, and the wattles are the two appendages under the chin. These are 
                        secondary sexual characteristics and are more prominent in the male. A few other birds have a comb or similar appendage, 
                        in some cases bearing a different name such as helmet in the guinea, and a few have wattles with some having a single median 
                        one rather than a pair. The comb is the basis of the Latin name or classification of chickens. In Latin, gallus means comb, 
                        and the domestic chicken is Gallus domesticus. The Red Jungle Fowl, ancestor of most domestic chickens, is Gallus bankiva. 
                        There are eight recognized kinds of combs: single, rose, pea, cushion, buttercup, strawberry, V-shaped, and silkie.
                        The chicken has two legs and two wings, a fact that influences housing and management. Domestic chickens have essentially 
                        lost the ability to fly. Heavy breeds used for meat production cannot do more than flap their wings and jump to a little 
                        higher level or move more rapidly along the ground. The lighter-bodied birds can fly short distances, and some can fly over 
                        relatively high fences. The feet and shank portions of the legs have scales. <br>
                        Respiration rate is higher in chickens than in larger animals. In general, it can be said that the smaller the kind of bird 
                        the faster it breathes. For example, a hummingbird breathes more times a minute than a chicken. The male chicken breathes 
                        about 18 to 21 times a minute and the female about 31 to 37 times when they are not under stress.
                        The heart beat of chickens is rather fast, being about 286 times a minute in males and 312 in females in a resting condition.
                        Digestion rate is somewhat rapid in chickens. It varies from 2 1/2 to 25 hours for passage of food depending on whether the 
                        digestion tract is full, partially full, or empty when feed is ingested. <br>
                        The chicken's temperature is about 107 degrees to 107.5 degrees F. <br>
                        Chickens are hatched, not born in the truest sense of the word. <br>
                        Chickens are covered with feathers but have a few vestigial hairs scattered over the body. The average consumer does not 
                        see these hairs, because they are singed off in the processing plant. The chicken has a beak (or bill) and does not have 
                        teeth. Any mastication occurs in the gizzard. Many commercial poultry producers do not provide grit to their chickens, 
                        because they feed a ground feed of fine meal consistency that can be digested by the bird's digestive juices.
                        The chicken has pneumatic bones, making its body lighter for flying, if it had not lost the ability to do so. 
                        There are 13 air sacs in the chicken's body, again to make the body lighter, and they are a functioning part of the 
                        respiratory system. Chickens have comparatively short life spans. Some live to be 10 to 15 years old, but they are the 
                        exception, not the rule. In commercial egg production, birds are about 18 months old when they are replaced by new, 
                        young stock. It takes close to six months for a female chicken to mature sexually and start laying eggs. Then, they are 
                        kept for 12 to 14 months of egg production. After that their economic value declines rapidly, so they are disposed of when 
                        they are about 18 months old. Chickens have both white (breast) and dark (legs, thighs, back, and neck) meat. The wings 
                        contain both light and dark fibers. There are approximately 175 varieties of chickens grouped into 12 classes and 
                        approximately 60 breeds. A class is a group of breeds originating in the same geographical area. The names themselves 
                        — Asiatic, American, Mediterranean, and so on — indicate the region where the breeds originated. <br>
